# portfolio-game

A city-inspired 3D personal portfolio built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Babylon.js**.

The website uses a miniature city as the main navigation. Instead of scrolling through pages, you explore the city, click key buildings, and open different portfolio sections like **About**, **Projects**, **Skills**, **Experience**, and **Contact**. Each building acts as an entry point, with deeper project views available inside.

The goal is to make browsing the portfolio feel tactile and playful, closer to a small interactive world than a traditional website. Camera movement, smooth transitions, and a lightweight HUD help guide the experience without getting in the way.
